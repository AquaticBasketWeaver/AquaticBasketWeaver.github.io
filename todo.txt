Future:
    - Start pulling imgs from s3

Present:
    - When you click the sandwich bar button again, it closes the navbar drop down thing
    - you need even less padding for the work experiences in mobile view (and maybe add more padding again for desktop view)
    - Add a "More photos" button to the photos section that leads to a new page
    - Fix metadata related stuff

If you have time:
    - Portrait mode on mobile is hot trash (might actually be fixed now)
    - Fix navbar highlight button behaviour when at top of page (and navbar is transparent)
    - fix the !important in Photography.js
    - improve navbar code
    - possibly compress the images in the img folder a bit
