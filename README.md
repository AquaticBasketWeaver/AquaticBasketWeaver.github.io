# Personal Website

This is just a personal website project, where I'll be experimenting with different front-end ideas and incorporating some of my hobbies into content. Visit it at: https://aquaticbasketweaver.github.io/

# Notes

The term "local" here can sometimes be a little confusing when it comes to `config.json` and deploying. Just for reference:
- "prod" means it uses aws to get media such as photos. Since the free tier has run out for me, I'm going to stop using this one as it costs money
- "local" means it uses the images that are stored in this repo. This isn't the greatest since it's a bit slower than aws in my experience, and I can't add too many photos, but it'll do for the time being
- "dev" is for local development. It adds an extra delay to simulate a network call
